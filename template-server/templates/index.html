    <h1>Backbone</h1>
    <p>
        [Intro]<br>
Indestructible<br>
On this rock, I lie, but I'm alive for good<br>
And I just free myself for now from all what was wrong<br>
Break the unbreakable
    </p>
    <p>
        [Verse 1]<br>
All the stars fearlessly bright<br>
They call me out there, order me to face the wind<br>
My structure's alive, body's on the way<br>
Don't bow down before the walls<br>
Of fear and madness, they try to counter me<br>
And strike me down to the ground again<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        [Verse 2]<br>
Inexhaustible<br>
The strength of fire is running through me<br>
Spine-like beam of light<br>
What mortal could ever break this force?<br>
Unconstrained<br>
I see at last my backbone straighten<br>
Thy serpent made of bones<br>
Finally rise up from the ground awaken<br>
    </p>
    <p>
[Outro]<br>
Beat your feet on the ground now, <b>GO!</b>
    </p>
